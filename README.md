# Ben's README Generator

## Description

This project generates a README.md file, after asking the user about their own project. I want to be able to help coders come up with a README that has some coherent structure, which could appeal to their spectators.

I myself learned about the general purpose and format of a README.md file. This project also helped develop my understanding of importing modules from npm packages, libraries, and other files.
